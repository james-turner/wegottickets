1. Requirements
 - PHPUnit is installed locally and executable via the cmd line by the current user.
 - An internet connection is present for running the integration tests

2. Assumptions
 - Matching is a more of an art and will not yield great results 100% of the time.
 - WeGotTickets.com render valid XHTML!
 - WeGotTickets.com are nice enough to let us spam their service

3. Dependencies
 - Comes packaged with the Zend_Http_Client, as there's no point in re-inventing the wheel.

4. Catches
 - As the site changes relatively freqently and there is a possibility that a listing
   might move between 2 search results pages (i.e. appear like a duplication) a decision
   was made to pull all the listing pages simultaneously using multi curl handling.


5. Runner
 - The runner can be invoked from cmd line with the url of the WeGotTickets page that is
   to be scraped.
   e.g. php bin/Runner.php http://www.wegottickets.com/searchresults/page/5/all

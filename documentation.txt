The WeGotTickets UK homepage is at http://www.wegotickets.co.uk/. Write a PHP script that scrapes concert
information from the pages on this site and outputs the data file in a machine readable format of your choice
(e.g. JSON, XML or CSV)

To get you started, here is the first page of the ‘browse all listings’ section of the site:

http://www.wegotickets.com/searchresults/page/1/all

Each event also has its own page, which is linked to from the event titles in the above. Your script should
attempt to spider all result pages and from the event page identify...

- the artists playing,
- the city,
- the name of the venue,
- the date,
- the price.

You may choose to include additional information which you think might be of interest. We are aware that
it is next to impossible to get perfect data for these fields!
We are only interested in musical events, but don’t worry if your script outputs data for other kinds of
events (comedy etc.) If they appear in your script’s output you can assume that they will be safely ignored.

Before you begin
Remember, fiddling around to get perfect data is much less important than making sure you are pleased
with your code quality and having something that works end-to-end at least minimally. Please try to
make it OO and if you need to use libary of some kind you may but make sure you deliver enough of your
own so we can assess your ability.
